        sonic would win because sonic in terms of speed goku and hulk can't
        catch up to him and goku can only hurt in in super saiayn god, while
        goku is stronger sonic is faster and sonic in hyper would lose to ui and
        mui because of the insane speed they have goku would lose because of the
        power of mui so sonic would win but if goku got so many zenkais he'd
        maybe win unless in ssg ssgss ssgss kkx10 to 20 ui mui sonic couldn't do
        anything sonic could win if he trained but nah who we kidding and sonic
        can win in speed

        HYPER SONIC IS THE WINNER with ease. Hyper Sonic One Shots UI and MUI,
        all of the DBS Universe. If Super Sonic is more powerful than Solaris
        who can collapse everything into nothingness. Eggman stated that Solaris
        was capable of destroying all existing timelines and collapse time
        itself into nothingness And Timelines are the exact same as
        dimensions/Universes/Realities in the Sonicverse which he was about to
        destroy every single dimension, which would also include the
        Maginaryworld the Sonic Nexus. A dimension that contains the 4th
        Dimension itself, which has Innumerable amount of Dimensions. Not only
        that, but he was also born not only due to Ibils and Mephiles but also
        the power of the Chaos Emeralds itself. So all of his feats are Chaos
        Energy powered, and the Chaos Emeralds have been Consistently stated in
        the series to be an source of infinite power since even the classic era
        “But Sonic needed the help of Shadow and Silver to accomplish this feat
        so it's not all by his merit!" Not only this mean nothing since he still
        scales to them, but also there's the fact that Solaris is an
        Transcendent life form that exists in 3 periods of time, the past,
        present and Future and each of the Super Hedgehogs needed to take him on
        by himself on each period. Aka Temporal Omnipresence what is Temporal
        Omnipresence you may ask? Well it's this Temporal Presence: The power to
        be in the past, present and future at the same time. Sub-power of
        Omnipresence. Opposite to Temporal Lock. High Multiversal+There's also
        the fact that the 06 Guide itself states that Super Sonic had already
        enough power and strength to defeat Solaris.Sonic might be universal in
        his base because he was able to fight universal gods before in his base.
        (BTW, the music for this boss battle is so fucking cool, but this is
        expected for every sonic game lmao.) I might have to give it to Sonic
        here due to him having loads of more stamina then Goku and him taking a
        lot of beatings, but, Goku does have the superior durability then Sonic,
        So errr, maybe I’d have to give it to Goku here, but this is debatable.
        In his strongest form, well, that’s not really needed, as Super form
        himself already beats MUI Goku. Now, Sonic in his Super form was able to
        fight Solaris and damage his armor Now, Solaris is stated to eat
        universes themselves for lunch Now, not only that, but Solaris himself
        was existing in the Past, present, and future themselves See that? Well,
        Sonic was able to tank and actually attack his armor. Making his Super
        form at least multiversal, maybe universal if lowballed, his durability
        should also be at that same amount in Super form. So, Super form already
        beats Goku, and before people say that Super form runs out, well,
        actually, it stays for days and most likely even weeks (although not
        confirmed, but it is confirmed that he could stay for days). But lets
        look at Hyper form. Ok, gonna admit, Hyper form has almost no feats at
        all, but if we do some scaling, Hyper form is most likely WAYYY stronger
        then Super form, so. Hyper form is big strong, therefore, DBS Goku Hyper
        form. Overall, DBS Goku loses to Sonic. Xeno Goku wins to Game Sonic,
        but he might be comparable to a Archie sonic, although, im not sure.

        photo for Jack Robinsons Jack Robinsons , Debater that tries to be
        unbiased Answered Feb 6, 2021 I’ve already answered a question extremely
        similar to this, so I’m gonna shorten it. Remember, this is my opinion,
        you do not have to agree. I will also make it clear that I am biased
        here. Now let’s start. Base Goku vs Base Sonic: Goku stomps. Base Goku
        vs Super Sonic: Sonic one-shots. SSJ Goku vs Super Sonic: Sonic wins.
        SSJ2 Goku vs Super Sonic: Sonic wins. SSJ3 Goku vs Super Sonic:
        Stalemate, or Sonic wins. SSJG Goku vs Super Sonic: Goku wins. SSJG Goku
        vs Hyper Sonic: Sonic negs. SSJB Goku vs Hyper Sonic: Sonic wins. SSJBKK
        Goku vs Hyper Sonic: Sonic should win. UI Sign Goku vs Hyper Sonic:
        Stalemate or Goku wins. MUI Goku(or whatever you wanna call it) vs Hyper
        Sonic: Goku wins. Bonus: SSJ4 Goku vs Darkspine Sonic: Both can win.
        Sonic loses in Base. Yes Goku has immeasurable speed & is multiversal+
        but unfortunately Hyper Sonic is Outerversal when scaling to his weaker
        forms. Goku may not be able to harm Sonic & Goku can outspeed him but
        Chaos Control GG man. Not even Super Saiyan 4 makes him much higher in
        terms of tier. Goku is stuck.
